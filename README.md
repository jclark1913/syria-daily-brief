# Syria Daily Brief

SDB is a web scraper designed to gather posts, articles and press announcements from a variety of Arabic-language sources run by governments, non-state actors and independent press. This project is designed to complement the work of Syria-focused analysts, particularly those who deal with large quantities of open-source data.

The project is currently in development.

### Why?

Tracking news and press releases is time-consuming, particularly when dealing with press releases and propaganda from governments and non-state actors. As a former analyst and perennial Syria-watcher, I want to build tools that ease this process - to streamline the gathering, translating and curating processes so more time can be spent analyzing trends and sentiments rather than monitoring social media feeds.

### Core Features

- Collect data from dozens of Arabic-language websites
	- Choose how far back you'd like to gather data and from which sources (Last 24 hrs, last week, last 6 months)
	- Gather data from a single source based on parameters you provide or cast a wide net to all available sources.
- Manage collected data
	- Explore collected data through responsive GUI
	- Search, tag and filter entries depending on your content
	- Export data to .csv, .xlsx formats
- Get reliable translations from Argos Translate
- Summarize data quickly using OpenAI API

### Planned features

- Named-entity recognition (NER) to automatically curate data
- Passive data collection: Gather from selected sources at regularly scheduled intervals
- Mapping: Using NER to plot developments on an interactive map.
